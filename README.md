**What is the background of your company? What do they do? Who are their competitors?**

Equifax Inc. is an American multinational consumer credit reporting agency and is one of the three largest consumer credit reporting agencies, along with Experian and TransUnion (together known as the "Big Three").[5] Equifax collects and aggregates information on over 800 million individual consumers and more than 88 million businesses worldwide.

Equifax NeuroDecision Technology is a neural network that computes credit scores (a.k.a. credit ratings)
for individuals, those all-important numbers that determine your fate when you apply for a loan. In the
past, neural network models have been used for credit scoring much less than might be expected, given
their ability to identify the non-linear relationships in typical inputs to scoring models. This is because the
basis on which traditional neural networks generate their results is not readily explainable, a situation that
regulators, such as the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the European General Data
Protection Regulation, find unacceptable. Equifax’s technology offers the power of a well trained neural
net, but one with the ability to explain its decision making.

**How does this company use technology to their advantage? Why are they considered a FinTech company?**

In the past, such scores were
computed via logistic regression, a technique that attempts to partition the data using linear functions.
However, nonlinear relationships are embedded in the data that might predict the likelihood of defaulting
on, say, credit card debt (Such an example might be the relationship between income and default
probability: once income gets above a certain level, people are less likely to have to choose between
credit card payments and feeding their children.). Neural nets certainly solve this problem, but they do so
by “learning” an obscure and nonlinear weighting scheme. NeuroDecision technology attempts to
identify the reasons why its neural net’s calculations turn out the way they do.


**Why is this company exemplary in the FinTech space? What are their strengths and weaknesses?**

    Equifax is one of the “big three” credit rating agencies, each of which provide prospective lenders with a numerical score that indicates the credit worthiness of just about any prospective U.S. borrower. 
    Neural nets certainly solve this problem, but they do so
by “learning” an obscure and nonlinear weighting scheme. NeuroDecision technology attempts to
identify the reasons why its neural net’s calculations turn out the way they do

**What is the prognosis for this company? Where do they expect to be in the future?**

The company's prognosis is profitable; it's one of the big three credit scoring companies in the country. They are already implementing machine learning to assist in analyzing credit scores. They expect to continue to use ML to find nonlinear patterns to determine someone's worthiness of the loan. To continue to be successful, the company needs to be more transparent about how the scores were calculated to customers if a customer is denied or questions how their score was obtained. In the future, they expect to be a cornerstone of credit scoring.
